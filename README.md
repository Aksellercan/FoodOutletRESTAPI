# FoodOutletRESTAPIDatabase

Using XAMPP Apache and MySql modules go to the admin page and import the foodoutletdb.sql file to the database.

TODO SPA Front-end and fixing authorization so that an user login will be required to post a review on an outlet and maybe will add an admin who has access to every function on the API.
