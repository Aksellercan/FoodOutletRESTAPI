### Data Models

-   **User**
    
-   **Review**
    
-   **FoodOutlet**
    
Each user can write multiple reviews, and each outlet can have many reviews (one-to-many relationships).

## API Overview

### Controllers

-   `UserController`
    
-   `FoodOutletController`
    
-   `LoginController`
    
-   `ReviewsController`

### User Roles & Security

-   All new accounts are created with the role `"User"` by default.
    
-   Role `"Admin"` **must be assigned manually** in the database.
    
-   This is an intentional design decision to prevent privilege escalation via API manipulation.
