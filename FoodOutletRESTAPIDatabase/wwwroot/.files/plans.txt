New stuff to add to API

1. Optimizing User related Info:

- Make a JS class or file to keep user info of currently logged in user. Info includes Id, username and mail (when added).
- This file will run once get current user by querying database through API.
- On log out this "object" will get removed or cleared out.

Benefits of this is less API and Database calls thus making it faster

2. Optimizing readability

- Organize JS functions into separate files and import them into one main file to be used.
- Same for CSS files as well
- Rewrite Index.js and Homepage.js
- Organize it according to OOP and SOLID principles
- Try to make functions that can be reused.

Refactoring and making the program more extendible

Non important stuff: Add needed pages accordingly
